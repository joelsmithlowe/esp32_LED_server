# esp32_LED_server
```This is a LED server Joel Smith-Lowe built using the FastLED/Webserver libraries.```

**To get started make sure to download the required library files using the built in Library Manager in Arduino IDE.** 

1. Change Wireless settings to suit your network. SSID (Wireless Network ID) > Password > Static IP (Allocated IP address).
2. Correct the GPIO pin ID to suit your ESP32 device.
3. Change password if required otherwise the default will be assigned.
4. Connect to device using assigned IP.

This is **REST** api compatible. **Has only been tested on ESP32**, I am sure it will work on other arduino devices.
